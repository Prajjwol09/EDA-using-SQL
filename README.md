## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL

### Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **SQL Server–based Data Warehouse (Gold Layer)**.  
The analysis aims to understand data structure, validate data quality, and extract meaningful business insights related to **sales performance, customer behavior, product distribution, and revenue trends** using pure SQL.

---

## Analysis Workflow

The EDA process is structured into clear analytical steps for better readability and business understanding.

---

### 1. Database Exploration
- Explored database objects using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
- Inspected column-level metadata via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
- Verified table structure before performing analysis

**Purpose:** Ensure data readiness and schema clarity.

---

### 2. Dimension Exploration
- Analyzed customer geography (countries)
- Explored product hierarchy (category, subcategory, product name)

**Key Findings:**
- Customers are distributed across **6 countries**
- Products fall under **4 major categories**

---

### 3. Date & Time Exploration
- Identified earliest and latest order dates
- Calculated the total span of sales data
- Determined youngest and oldest customer ages

**Insights:**
- Sales data ranges from **2010 to 2014**
- Oldest customer age: **109**
- Youngest customer age: **39**

---

### 4. Measures & KPI Exploration
Calculated key business metrics including:
- Total Sales Revenue
- Total Quantity Sold
- Average Selling Price
- Total Number of Orders
- Total Number of Products
- Total Number of Customers

A consolidated **KPI summary report** was generated using `UNION ALL` to simulate a dashboard-style output.

---

### 5. Magnitude Analysis
Evaluated distribution and scale of business activities:
- Customers by country and gender
- Products by category
- Average product cost per category
- Revenue contribution by category
- Revenue generated by individual customers
- Item sales distribution across countries

**Key Observations:**
- United States has the highest customer base and sales volume
- Bikes category generates the highest revenue
- Accessories category has the lowest average cost

---

### 6. Ranking Analysis
Identified top and bottom performers using ranking techniques:
- Top 5 revenue-generating products
- Bottom 5 lowest-performing products
- Customers with the fewest orders

**Techniques Used:**
- `TOP`
- `ORDER BY`
- Window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER()`

---

## Outcome
This EDA delivers a **business-ready understanding** of:
- Sales performance trends
- Customer demographics and behavior
- Product performance and revenue contribution
- Geographic sales distribution

The project demonstrates how **SQL alone** can be leveraged to perform structured, insightful data analysis without relying on external BI tools.
